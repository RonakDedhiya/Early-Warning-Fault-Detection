# Time Series Forecast Using LSTM

Problem Statement :- Memory consumption of certain Edge Device is provided.
Here task is to learn from its past data and do prediction of next value in future

Tools :- Python 3.6, Tensorflow 1.4, Keras, Scikit (Sklearn)

Implementation :-
Time series forecast can  be done using statistical methods but here we approched
to use neural network to build a time series forecast model.
 After initial research, we found it to go with LSTM model which is good at detecting
 sequences and can  be used for time series forecasts

 I have referred [Time Series Forecast Using LStM](https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-forecasting-long-short-term-memory-network-python/)
 Tutorial from Machine Learning mastery website which has explaned explicitly in
 detail about building LSTM model from scratch. I have used very simple model of
 LSTM. There are lot many variations that can be done for enhancing the model.

 Please refer the tutorial [Link](https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-forecasting-long-short-term-memory-network-python/) to follow on LSTM.
 Codes are annotated with comments for better understanding.
